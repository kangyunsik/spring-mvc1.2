### 1. About Log

Instead of System.out.pringln(), logging should be used. This is because logging provides a number of convenient functions, such as multi-threading processing and performance optimization, as well as saving to a file and compressing and backing up when it exceeds a certain amount or saving only a certain amount of space.
Also, the output log level can be set using setting information such as applicaton.properties.
slf4j is an interface for logging, and logback of slf4j is one of its implementations.
